## StudentMarkAnalyser: Students' Exam Mark Analysing App: [Link](https://menashasenanayaka.shinyapps.io/studentmarkanalyser_app/)

The app is designed to conduct the analysis in a user-friendly manner. 

* First, a marks dataset should be used as the input. It should be a csv file.
* The dataset should contain the marks and grades in separate columns. 
* If the users can analyse assignment marks, mid semester exam marks, final exam marks and the total marks by uploading a dataset with all those variables in separate columns. 
* If the users need to analyse question-wise marks. Then, the question-wise marks should be entered in separate columns of the uploaded dataset. 
* The preview of the dataset and grade distribution appears on the first tab.
* The second tab is designed to give the summary statistics, and it will include the minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode, standard deviation and interquartile range. 
* The third tab is to visualize the distributions. The users can select one or more variables from the drop-down menu, and the outputs will be a histogram and a boxplot. The users can navigate through the tabs and obtain the needed insights. 
* The last tab is to demonstrate relationships between variables. The users can select two variables for the x-axis and y-axis from the drop-down menu, and the output will be a scatterplot. 
* The analysis is done only for the students who participated in the final examination and possess a grade.
* The uploaded datasets will not be saved or shared with any third-party. The app is safe to use

This shiny app will be helpful to someone who has a marks dataset and needs help with the analysis. Anyone needing to conduct an analysis from a mark sheet using an interactive tool can take advantage of this shiny app. Even the users who are not familiar with obtaining statistical outputs from software can take the maximum benefit from this app.
